"""Certify a pipeline, not a stage: composing rank certificates (issue #182).

The consumer of a retrieval system does not read the output of one codec. It
reads the end of a chain: an encoder, a compressed index, an approximate
search, a reranker. Each stage may carry its own rank certificate, and each
certificate is a statement about that stage alone. The application's question
is about the composition.

Two things compose, and this module is careful to distinguish them.

**The chain itself.** A certificate records the sha256 of the arrays it was
issued over. A chain is well formed when each stage's reconstructed hash is
the next stage's original hash. That check is exact and it is the one that
catches a pipeline assembled out of stages that were never connected, or a
stage silently re-run on different data. A chain that does not connect is
refused; nothing is composed over it.

**The distortion.** ``kappa`` is a ratio of distances, so bi-Lipschitz
constants multiply: a stage that moves every pairwise distance by at most a
factor ``k1`` followed by one that moves it by at most ``k2`` moves it by at
most ``k1 k2``. The chain's floor is then the corpus's own inversion at the
product, ``tau >= 1 - 2 mu_hat(product)``, evaluated on the *source*
distances, which is why a sample of the source is required rather than
optional.

**The caveat that travels with it.** `certify` measures kappa between the
2.5th and 97.5th percentiles by default, trimming the most distorted pairs.
Trimmed constants do not compose exactly: the product of two robust kappas
bounds the composition's robust kappa only under the assumption that the
trimmed pairs of the two stages are not adversarially disjoint. The strict
constants (``lo=0, hi=100``) do compose unconditionally. The report states
which kind it composed and refuses to call a robust composition
unconditional.
