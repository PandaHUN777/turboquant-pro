//! The `tqvector` encoding, frozen (issue #165).
//!
//! The existing roundtrip tests check that pack-then-unpack agrees with itself
//! *in the current build*. That is a much weaker property than the one a
//! persisted format needs, because both sides of such a test move together: a
//! change that silently re-encodes every vector still passes. Rows already in
//! a table do not get to move with it.
//!
//! Two layers, as the issue asks.
//!
//! **Golden bytes.** A fixed input, run through today's encoder, must produce
//! the exact bytes recorded here. Any change to a codebook constant, to the
//! packing order, or to the rotation generator fails loudly instead of
//! re-encoding in silence. The fixtures span all three bit widths and both
//! rotation regimes: `MAX_QR_DIM` is **512**, so dims at and below it take the
//! Gram-Schmidt path and dims above it take the sign-flip path. (The issue
//! says 1024; the constant in `compress.rs` says 512, and the fixtures follow
//! the code.)
//!
//! **Properties.** Roundtrip behaviour over arbitrary dims, widths and value
//! distributions, including the cases hand-written tests miss: dims that are
//! not a multiple of 8 for 3-bit packing, single-element vectors, all-zero
//! vectors, and values far outside the codebook's range.
//!
//! Regenerating the fixtures is deliberately a manual act. If a change to the
//! encoder is intended, run
//!
//! ```text
//! TQVECTOR_REGENERATE_FIXTURES=1 cargo test --features pg16 print_golden_fixtures -- --nocapture
//! ```
//!
//! and paste the printed table below, in the same commit as the format version
//! bump, so the diff shows the bytes changing and says why.
